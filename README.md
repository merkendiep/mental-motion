This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Mental Motion - Student Peer Support Center

This application provides a platform for managing events and facilitating peer support for students.

## Features

- **Event Management**: Events are stored and retrieved from Supabase database
- **Event Calendar**: Visual calendar showing all upcoming events
- **Event Registration**: Users can register for events directly through the platform
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dedicated services and components

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Add your Supabase credentials:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

For detailed Supabase setup instructions, see [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](./SUPABASE_SETUP.md).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
